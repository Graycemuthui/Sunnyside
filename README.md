## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I got to revise on HTML, CSS AND JS. Also got to get a better understanding of creating a hamburger menu with a different approach from what I am used to. I also learnt how to use grid.

- Here is some code I'm proud of

```html
<div class="hamburger">
  <span class="bar"></span>
  <span class="bar"></span>
  <span class="bar"></span>
</div>
```

```css
.clip-path: polygon(0 4%, 90% 4%, 100% 0, 100% 99%, 75% 100%, 30% 100%, 0 100%);
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".nav-links").forEach((n) =>
  n.addEventListener("click", () => {
    hamburger.classList.remove("active");
    navLinks.classList.remove("active");
  })
);
```

### Useful resources

- [Hamburger Menu](https://dev.to/ljcdev/easy-hamburger-menu-with-js-2do0) - This helped me with my hamburger menu.
- [Clipper](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - This helped me create the message like shape on the hamburger menu.
